    <p>Welcome, Rotary Club members, to Asha Lata.
My name is Krishna Dubey. I completed my 12th standard education here at Asha Lata, and later graduated in 2018. Currently, I am pursuing my post-graduation in English. Now, I'm back at Asha Lata as a computer teacher, dedicated to helping visually impaired students learn valuable computer skills. Asha Lata has played a significant role in shaping my life and achieving my goals.
I'd like to extend my heartfelt appreciation to each of you for organizing this remarkable Diwali celebration. This is a historic moment, as Diwali has never been celebrated in Asha Lata's 25-year history. Although I may not be able to see you, your efforts have truly made a significant impact. Thank you for your kindness, compassion, and dedication.</p>
